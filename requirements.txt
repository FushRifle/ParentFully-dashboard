ParentFully admin dashboard, so let’s think about it strategically. You want pages that give admins control over users, children, subscriptions, reports, and maybe some analytics. Here’s a structured breakdown:

1. User & Family Management
Users List – overview of all users (parents, guardians). Includes search, filters, and actions (edit, delete, view).
User Details – shows full profile, children linked, subscription plan, activity logs.
Child Management – per user, manage children, profiles, and group memberships.
Invite & Connections – see invites sent, accept/reject, QR codes, referral codes.

2. Subscription & Payments
Plans Overview – all subscription plans, limits, pricing.
Change Plan – per user plan update.
Payments History – payments made, outstanding, failed transactions.
Credits & Balances – if users have credits (like in ParentFully), 
show balances and adjustments.

3. Analytics & Reports
Usage Analytics – app sessions, login activity, active users.
Child Engagement – tasks completed, messages sent, activity trends.
Financial Reports – total revenue, active subscriptions, refunds, etc.

4. Security & Logs
Security Logs – per user, login history, password changes, API key usage.
Admin Activity Logs – track who changed what on the dashboard.

5. Settings & Config
Dashboard Settings – global app settings, notification templates.
Roles & Permissions – define admin roles, access levels.
Templates & Messaging – email/SMS templates, default messages for invites.

6. Optional / Advanced
